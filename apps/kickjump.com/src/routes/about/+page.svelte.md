# About

- X% of projects worldwide use open source software as some part of their infrastructure..
- Open source is literally eating the world.
- Software developers, designers and engineers who open source their work are creating huge amounts of value for the ecosystem.

## Problem

Despite the huge value that is created x% of projects with non-trivial usage are not funded.

## Mindshare

- As project rises in utility it brings more benefits to companies
- Companies start hiring for those with skills in the requisite area
- Individuals land jobs based on being skilled at the open source project
- Jobs are often 6 figure salaries and the recruiters pocket a 5 figure fee for connecting the parties.

The open source project hasn't benefitted from any of this.

It captures mindshare and yet doesn't receive any renumeration.

An alternative would be to create a new platform that allows companies to hire developers accredited by the open source projects as being skilled in certain areas. These credentials can be earned by developers across a variety of projects.

Rather then going through a recruiter, the top developers with top accreditations can be hired directly from this platform. There would be a connection fee of around 5% of first years salary / daily rate if contract role.
