## Description

Open source software has taken over the world.

For almost anything productive that is being worked on, whether at a company, artistic work, music or a side project, you are relying on open source software at some layer of the stack.

Since this footprint is so large the value created by open source developer is huge.

The problem is that almost none of the value created is passed onto the teams behind these open source projects. This is true even of ecosystem critical projects. Creators find themselves pleading for enough to sustain their work.

**KickJump** solves this fundamental problem by providing a toolkit for open source developers to build financially sustainable projects.

- Stakeholders can financially speculate on via project tokens.
- Governance via tokens and credentials.
- Project specific rules around governance.
- Explore avenues for enhancing value creation of project stakeholders via zero-effort revenue share arrangements.
